# Karplus-Strong Algorithm and Plucked String Synthesis

## 1. Introduction to Physical Modeling Synthesis

Physical modeling synthesis is a powerful technique in digital sound synthesis that aims to simulate the physical mechanisms by which sounds are produced. Unlike other synthesis methods that focus on recreating the sound itself, physical modeling attempts to replicate the underlying physical processes that generate the sound. This approach often leads to more realistic and expressive results, particularly for simulating acoustic instruments.

The Karplus-Strong algorithm, developed by Kevin Karplus and Alex Strong in 1983, represents a significant milestone in the field of physical modeling synthesis. It provides a computationally efficient method for simulating plucked string instruments, such as guitars, harps, and banjos. The algorithm's elegance lies in its simplicity: it uses a combination of a delay line and a simple filter to create surprisingly realistic string sounds.

To understand the significance of the Karplus-Strong algorithm, it's essential to consider its historical context. Prior to its development, most digital synthesis techniques relied on additive or subtractive synthesis, which often produced artificial-sounding results when attempting to mimic acoustic instruments. The Karplus-Strong algorithm, along with other physical modeling techniques that followed, opened up new possibilities for creating more natural and expressive digital instruments.

## 2. Mathematical Foundations of the Karplus-Strong Algorithm

The Karplus-Strong algorithm is based on a simplified physical model of a vibrating string. To understand its mathematical foundations, let's first consider the wave equation that describes the motion of an ideal string:
$$
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $y(x,t)$ is the displacement of the string at position $x$ and time $t$, and $c$ is the wave speed on the string. This partial differential equation describes the propagation of waves along the string.

The Karplus-Strong algorithm approximates this continuous system with a discrete-time model. The key insight is that a vibrating string can be modeled as a traveling wave that reflects back and forth between the string's fixed ends. In the digital domain, this can be simulated using a delay line.

The basic equation for the Karplus-Strong algorithm can be expressed as:
$$
y(n) = \frac{1}{2}[y(n-N) + y(n-N-1)]
$$

where $y(n)$ is the output sample at time $n$, and $N$ is the length of the delay line. This equation represents a simple low-pass filter applied to the delayed signal.

The frequency of the fundamental tone produced by this system is given by:
$$
f_0 = \frac{f_s}{N}
$$

where $f_s$ is the sampling frequency. This relationship allows us to control the pitch of the synthesized string by adjusting the length of the delay line.

The transfer function of the basic Karplus-Strong algorithm in the z-domain can be written as:
$$
H(z) = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{2}(1 + z^{-1})z^{-N}}
$$

This transfer function reveals the feedback nature of the algorithm, with the term $z^{-N}$ representing the delay line and $\frac{1}{2}(1 + z^{-1})$ representing the low-pass filter.

## 3. Basic Structure and Components of the Karplus-Strong Algorithm

The Karplus-Strong algorithm consists of several key components that work together to simulate the sound of a plucked string. Let's examine each of these components in detail:

### 3.1 Excitation

The excitation represents the initial pluck or strike of the string. In the digital domain, this is typically simulated by filling the delay line with random noise or a short burst of energy. The characteristics of this initial excitation significantly influence the timbre of the resulting sound.

### 3.2 Delay Line

The delay line is the core component of the Karplus-Strong algorithm. It simulates the propagation of waves along the string by storing and delaying the signal. The length of the delay line determines the fundamental frequency of the simulated string, as described by the equation in the previous section.

In practice, the delay line is often implemented as a circular buffer, which allows for efficient memory usage and easy manipulation of the delay length.

### 3.3 Low-Pass Filter

The low-pass filter in the Karplus-Strong algorithm serves two purposes:

1. It simulates the energy loss in the string, causing higher frequencies to decay more rapidly than lower frequencies.
2. It helps to smooth out the transitions between samples, reducing aliasing and improving the overall sound quality.

The simplest form of the low-pass filter in the Karplus-Strong algorithm is the two-point average filter described by the equation:
$$
y(n) = \frac{1}{2}[x(n) + x(n-1)]
$$

where $x(n)$ is the input sample and $y(n)$ is the output sample.

### 3.4 Feedback Loop

The feedback loop is crucial for sustaining the oscillation of the simulated string. It feeds the output of the low-pass filter back into the delay line, creating a recursive system that mimics the continuous vibration of a real string.

The strength of the feedback determines the decay time of the sound. A feedback gain slightly less than 1 ensures that the sound will eventually decay, simulating the energy loss in a real string.

## 4. Algorithm Variations and Extensions

Since its introduction, the Karplus-Strong algorithm has been the subject of numerous variations and extensions aimed at improving its realism and versatility. Some notable modifications include:

### 4.1 Extended Karplus-Strong Algorithm

The Extended Karplus-Strong (EKS) algorithm, introduced by David A. Jaffe and Julius O. Smith III, addresses some limitations of the original algorithm. It includes features such as:

- Allpass interpolation for improved tuning accuracy
- Separate loop filters for controlling decay rates of different harmonics
- Stretching of the harmonic series to simulate string stiffness

The transfer function of the EKS algorithm can be expressed as:
$$
H(z) = \frac{1}{1 - gz^{-L}A(z)S(z)}
$$

where $g$ is the loop gain, $L$ is the loop delay, $A(z)$ is the allpass interpolation filter, and $S(z)$ is the string stiffness filter.

### 4.2 Commuted Synthesis

Commuted synthesis, developed by Julius O. Smith III, is a technique that can be applied to the Karplus-Strong algorithm to more efficiently model the interaction between the string and the instrument body. It works by pre-computing the impulse response of the instrument body and convolving it with the excitation signal before feeding it into the string model.

### 4.3 Waveguide Synthesis

Waveguide synthesis, also developed by Julius O. Smith III, generalizes the principles of the Karplus-Strong algorithm to model a wider range of acoustic systems. It uses bidirectional delay lines to simulate the propagation of waves in various media, allowing for the modeling of complex instruments like woodwinds and brass.

## 5. Implementation and Applications

### 5.1 Practical Implementation Techniques

Implementing the Karplus-Strong algorithm in practice involves several considerations:

1. **Buffer Management**: Efficient implementation of the delay line using circular buffers is crucial for real-time performance.

2. **Interpolation**: To achieve precise tuning, especially for high frequencies, fractional delay line lengths are necessary. This can be achieved through various interpolation techniques, such as linear interpolation or allpass interpolation.

3. **Excitation Signal**: The choice of excitation signal significantly affects the timbre of the resulting sound. Common choices include white noise, filtered noise, or recorded samples of actual string plucks.

4. **Filter Design**: More sophisticated implementations may use higher-order filters for the loop filter to achieve more realistic decay characteristics.

Here's a basic implementation of the Karplus-Strong algorithm in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def karplus_strong(freq, duration, sample_rate=44100):
    N = int(sample_rate / freq)
    buf = np.random.rand(N) * 2 - 1
    samples = []
    for _ in range(int(duration * sample_rate)):
        samples.append(buf[0])
        avg = 0.5 * (buf[0] + buf[1])
        buf = np.roll(buf, -1)
        buf[-1] = avg
    return np.array(samples)

# Generate a 440 Hz tone for 2 seconds
tone = karplus_strong(440, 2)
```

### 5.2 Applications in Music Synthesis
