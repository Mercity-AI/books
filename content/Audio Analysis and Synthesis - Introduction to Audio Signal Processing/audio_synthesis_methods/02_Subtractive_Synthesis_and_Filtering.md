# Subtractive Synthesis and Filtering

## 1. Introduction to Subtractive Synthesis

Subtractive synthesis is a fundamental technique in sound synthesis that has shaped the landscape of electronic music since its inception in the mid-20th century. At its core, subtractive synthesis involves generating a harmonically rich waveform and then selectively removing or attenuating specific frequency components to sculpt the desired timbre. This process mimics, to some extent, the way many acoustic instruments produce sound, where an initial excitation (like plucking a string or striking a drum) creates a complex waveform that is then shaped by the instrument's resonant body.

The origins of subtractive synthesis can be traced back to the early days of electronic music, with pioneers like Robert Moog and Don Buchla developing analog synthesizers in the 1960s. These instruments laid the groundwork for the subtractive synthesis techniques that continue to be used today, both in hardware and software implementations.

To understand subtractive synthesis, we must first consider the nature of sound itself. In physical terms, sound is a pressure wave that propagates through a medium, typically air. Mathematically, we can represent a simple sound wave using a sinusoidal function:
$$
y(t) = A \sin(2\pi ft + \phi)
$$

Where $A$ is the amplitude, $f$ is the frequency, $t$ is time, and $\phi$ is the phase offset. However, most musical sounds are far more complex than a single sine wave. They consist of multiple frequency components, often related harmonically, that combine to create rich and varied timbres.

In subtractive synthesis, we start with a waveform that contains many of these frequency components. Common starting waveforms include:

1. Sawtooth wave: Rich in both odd and even harmonics, providing a bright and buzzy sound.
2. Square wave: Contains only odd harmonics, resulting in a hollow, reedy timbre.
3. Triangle wave: Similar to the square wave but with a softer sound due to the faster attenuation of higher harmonics.
4. Noise: Contains all frequencies, useful for creating percussive or wind-like sounds.

The key to subtractive synthesis lies in the manipulation of these complex waveforms using filters, envelopes, and modulation techniques. By selectively removing or emphasizing certain frequency components, we can dramatically alter the character of the sound, creating a wide range of timbres from a single source.

## 2. Core Components of Subtractive Synthesis

### 2.1 Oscillators

Oscillators are the primary sound generators in a subtractive synthesizer. They produce the initial waveforms that serve as the raw material for further sound shaping. The most common types of oscillators in subtractive synthesis are:

1. **Voltage-Controlled Oscillators (VCOs)**: These are analog oscillators whose frequency can be controlled by an input voltage. The relationship between the control voltage and the output frequency is typically exponential, allowing for precise control over pitch.

2. **Digitally Controlled Oscillators (DCOs)**: These are digital oscillators that offer greater stability and tuning accuracy compared to VCOs, but may lack some of the subtle imperfections that give analog oscillators their characteristic sound.

3. **Wavetable Oscillators**: These oscillators use stored digital waveforms, allowing for a wider range of timbres beyond the basic analog waveforms.

The output of an oscillator can be mathematically represented as a sum of sinusoidal components:
$$
y(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \sin(2\pi nft + \phi_n)
$$

Where $A_n$ and $\phi_n$ are the amplitude and phase of the nth harmonic, respectively, and $f$ is the fundamental frequency.

### 2.2 Filters

Filters are perhaps the most crucial component in subtractive synthesis, as they perform the actual "subtraction" of frequency components from the oscillator's output. The most common types of filters in subtractive synthesis are:

1. **Low-Pass Filter (LPF)**: Allows frequencies below a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating higher frequencies.

2. **High-Pass Filter (HPF)**: Allows frequencies above a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating lower frequencies.

3. **Band-Pass Filter (BPF)**: Allows a specific range of frequencies to pass through while attenuating frequencies above and below this range.

4. **Notch Filter**: Attenuates a specific range of frequencies while allowing all others to pass through.

The behavior of a filter can be described by its transfer function, $H(s)$, which relates the output of the filter to its input in the complex frequency domain. For a simple first-order low-pass filter, the transfer function is:
$$
H(s) = \frac{1}{1 + s/\omega_c}
$$

Where $\omega_c = 2\pi f_c$ is the cutoff frequency in radians per second.

The frequency response of a filter, which describes how the filter affects the amplitude and phase of different frequency components, can be obtained by evaluating the transfer function along the imaginary axis:
$$
H(j\omega) = |H(j\omega)|e^{j\phi(\omega)}
$$

Where $|H(j\omega)|$ is the magnitude response and $\phi(\omega)$ is the phase response.

### 2.3 Envelopes

Envelopes are used to control how various parameters of the synthesizer change over time. The most common type of envelope in subtractive synthesis is the ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope, which controls the amplitude of the sound over time.

The ADSR envelope can be mathematically described as a piecewise function:
$$
E(t) = \begin{cases} 
      \frac{t}{T_A} & 0 \leq t < T_A \\
      1 - (1-L_S)\frac{t-T_A}{T_D} & T_A \leq t < T_A + T_D \\
      L_S & T_A + T_D \leq t < T_R \\
      L_S(1 - \frac{t-T_R}{T_R}) & T_R \leq t < T_R + T_R \\
      0 & t \geq T_R + T_R
   \end{cases}
$$

Where $T_A$, $T_D$, and $T_R$ are the attack, decay, and release times, respectively, and $L_S$ is the sustain level.

## 3. Advanced Filtering Techniques

### 3.1 State Variable Filters

State variable filters are a versatile type of filter that can simultaneously provide low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass outputs. They are particularly useful in subtractive synthesis due to their flexibility and musical sound.

The state variable filter can be described by a system of first-order differential equations:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dx_1}{dt} &= \omega_c x_2 \\
\frac{dx_2}{dt} &= -\omega_c x_1 - \alpha x_2 + \omega_c u
\end{aligned}
$$

Where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the state variables, $\omega_c$ is the cutoff frequency, $\alpha$ is a damping factor related to the filter's Q factor, and $u$ is the input signal.

The outputs of the state variable filter are then given by:
$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{LP} &= x_1 \\
y_{BP} &= x_2 \\
y_{HP} &= u - \alpha x_2 - x_1
\end{aligned}
$$

### 3.2 Ladder Filters

The ladder filter, popularized by the Moog synthesizer, is known for its distinctive sound and has become a staple in subtractive synthesis. It consists of a cascade of four one-pole low-pass filters with feedback.

The transfer function of a ladder filter can be approximated as:
$$
H(s) = \frac{1}{(1 + s/\omega_c)^4 + k}
$$

Where $k$ is a feedback parameter that controls the resonance of the filter.

### 3.3 Comb Filters

Comb filters are another important class of filters in subtractive synthesis, particularly useful for creating resonant and metallic sounds. A comb filter adds a delayed version of the input signal to itself, creating a series of regularly spaced notches in the frequency response.

The transfer function of a feedforward comb filter is:
$$
H(z) = 1 + gz^{-M}
$$

Where $g$ is the gain of the delayed signal and $M$ is the delay in samples.

## 4. Modulation Techniques in Subtractive Synthesis

Modulation is a crucial aspect of subtractive synthesis that allows for the creation of dynamic and expressive sounds. The two primary types of modulation in subtractive synthesis are:

### 4.1 Low-Frequency Oscillators (LFOs)

LFOs generate periodic waveforms at sub-audio frequencies (typically below 20 Hz) to modulate various parameters of the synthesizer. Common LFO waveforms include sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth.

The output of an LFO can be mathematically represented as:
$$
y(t) = A \sin(2\pi f_{LFO}t + \phi)
$$

Where $A$ is the amplitude, $f_{LFO}$ is the LFO frequency, and $\phi$ is the phase offset.

### 4.2 Envelope Modulation

In addition to controlling amplitude, envelopes can be used to modulate other parameters such as filter cutoff frequency or oscillator pitch. This allows for complex, time-varying sounds.

The modulation depth can be controlled by scaling the envelope output:
$$
y(t) = kE(t)
$$

Where $k$ is a scaling factor and $E(t)$ is the envelope function.

## 5. Case Studies: Iconic Subtractive Synthesizers

To illustrate the practical application of subtractive synthesis principles, let's examine some iconic synthesizers that have shaped the sound of electronic music:

### 5.1 Moog Minimoog

The Minimoog, introduced in 1970, was one of the first portable synthesizers and played a crucial role in popularizing subtractive synthesis. Its architecture included:

- Three VCOs with selectable waveforms
- A 24 dB/octave low-pass ladder filter
- Two ADSR envelope generators
- A noise generator

The Minimoog's filter is particularly noteworthy for its warm, musical sound and its ability to self-oscillate when the resonance is pushed to high levels.

### 5.2 Roland TB-303

The Roland TB-303, while initially a commercial failure as a bass accompaniment device for solo musicians, found new life in the 1980s as a key instrument in the development of acid house music. Its distinctive sound comes from:

- A single oscillator with selectable sawtooth or square wave
- A 24 dB/octave low-pass filter with high resonance capability
- An envelope generator that can be applied to both the filter cutoff and the amplitude

The TB-303's unique squelchy, resonant bass sound is achieved by modulating the filter cutoff and resonance in conjunction with the built-in sequencer.

## 6. Modern Implementations of Subtractive Synthesis

### 6.1 Software-Based Subtractive Synthesis

With the advent of powerful digital signal processing (DSP) technology, software-based subtractive synthesizers have become increasingly popular. These virtual instruments offer several advantages:

1. **Unlimited polyphony**: Software synths are not limited by hardware constraints and can often produce as many simultaneous voices as the host computer can handle.

2. **Complex modulation routing**: Virtual patching systems allow for intricate modulation schemes that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with hardware.

3. **Preset management**: Software synths can store and recall an unlimited number of presets, facilitating rapid sound design and experimentation.

4. **Integration with digital audio workstations (DAWs)**: Software synths can be easily automated and controlled within a DAW environment.

However, software synthesis also presents challenges, particularly in terms of CPU efficiency. The computational complexity of generating and filtering audio in real-time requires careful optimization of algorithms and efficient use of system resources.

### 6.2 Hybrid Synthesis Systems

Modern synthesizers often combine subtractive synthesis with other synthesis techniques to create more complex and versatile sound generation systems. Some common hybrid approaches include:

1. **Subtractive-Additive Synthesis**: Combining the harmonic control of additive synthesis with the filtering capabilities of subtractive synthesis.

2. **Subtractive-FM Synthesis**: Using frequency modulation to generate complex waveforms that are then processed using subtractive techniques.

3. **Subtractive-Wavetable Synthesis**: Employing wavetable oscillators as the initial sound source for subtractive processing, allowing for a wider range of timbres.

4. **Subtractive-Physical Modeling**: Using subtractive techniques to shape and filter sounds generated by physical modeling algorithms, creating more realistic or hybrid instrument sounds.

These hybrid systems leverage the strengths of multiple synthesis techniques, offering sound designers and musicians an expanded palette of timbral possibilities.

## Conclusion

Subtractive synthesis remains a cornerstone of sound design and electronic music production, offering a powerful and intuitive approach to shaping timbre. From its analog roots to modern digital implementations, the principles of subtractive synthesis continue to evolve and adapt to new technologies and musical styles.

As we've explored in this chapter, the interplay between oscillators, filters, envelopes, and modulation sources provides a rich framework for creating expressive and dynamic sounds.
